# Diferrences between SQL and Nosql
1. In relational databases you are storing data by using a explicit schema which describes how to write ata in the database including structure, types and structures of tables and records. You don't need that in nosql and can store data with any structure you wish.
2. SQL data is expressed as rows(field values), nosql data allows you to access data as documents (columns).
3. Main difference is that SQL databases support minimal transactions, but NoSQL systems allow transactions to run on ny row and transaction records, which is a big step forward in performance and scalability.
